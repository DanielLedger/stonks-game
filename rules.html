        <h3>The rules: </h3>
        <ul><li> You start with £15,000 to invest.</li>
            <li> There are eight companies to chose from. Each one has unique characteristics.</li>
            <li> If a companies' stonks reach a value of £0 or less, that company is bust, and you may no longer trade those stonks.</li>
            <li> At any time, you may cash out using the very large button at the base of your screen.</li>
            <li> Your score is the combined sum of your cash and the value of your stonks the instant you cash out.</li>
